# Brand Colors (First Tier)

The first tier of our design token abstraction consists of brand-specific colors. These colors uses literal color names (like red, green, etc.) and a numeric scale (where 000 is light and 900 is dark) by default. They form the foundation of our design system and are essential to maintaining visual consistency across our products.

While these colors are fundamental to our design system, they **should not** be used directly in most cases. The exception is when a color needs to remain the same regardless of the theme (light or dark mode). Instead, these brand colors should be referenced via [**theme colors**](/docs/colors-themecolors--docs), which form the second tier of our design tokens.

The majority of our brand color progressions were generated using the [0to255](https://0to255.com/037dd6) tool, which helps ensure smooth and consistent color transitions.

# Theme Colors (Second Tier)

Theme colors are derived from the first-tier [**brand colors**](/docs/colors-brandcolors--docs). They are applied to high-level applications within the UI and are considered second-tier tokens. These colors can be used directly in the code and should be used liberally throughout the codebase to ensure theme compatibility and accessibility in your components.

- [Light Theme Colors](#light-theme-colors)
- [Dark Theme Colors](#dark-theme-colors)

## Light Theme Colors

The light theme colors are designed to be used in the styles for MetaMask UI when the light theme is active

<Canvas of={ThemeColorStories.LightThemeColors} />

## Dark Theme Colors

The dark theme colors are designed for MetaMask UI when the dark theme is active. They have the same names as the light theme colors but different values. If you are using the light theme colors for their intended purpose, your UI will automatically be compatible with the dark theme.

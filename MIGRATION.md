### Updated CSS Import Paths (Breaking Changes)

In this version, we've updated the paths for importing CSS files to streamline the process and ensure consistency across projects. This change is considered a breaking change and requires updates to your project's import statements.

#### Before the Update

Previously, the CSS import path was structured as follows:

```css
import '../../node_modules/@metamask/design-tokens/src/css/design-token.css';
```

This path directed to the `src` directory, which might not always contain the most optimized version of the CSS.

#### After the Update

To improve efficiency and maintainability, the import path has been updated to:

```css
import '../../node_modules/@metamask/design-tokens/dist/styles.css';
```

This new path points to the `dist` directory, ensuring that you're importing the most optimized and production-ready version of the stylesheet.
